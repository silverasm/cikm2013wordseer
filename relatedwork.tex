There are numerous information analysis and discovery tools that allow users to view multidimensional data from different angles by selecting subsets of data, viewing those as visualizations, moving laterally to view other subsets of data, slicing into another view, expanding the viewed data by relaxing constraints, and so on.  However, these tools operate over numerical and categorical data, but do not seamlessly operate over raw textual information with the same flexibility. 

Current text analysis systems put computational linguistics and data visualization into the hands of users. Tools such as Jigsaw \cite{}, IBM TextMiner \cite{}, and SAS Text Analytics \cite{} take techniques like text classification, named-entity recognition, sentiment analysis and summarization and build systems to automate their use. To make the results of these computational analyses interpretable, they display the outputs with interactive data visualization. These systems have made advanced text mining and visualization algorithms available to users without expertise in those areas.
