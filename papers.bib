	abstract = {Motivation: The most widely used literature search techniques, such as those offered by {NCBI's} {PubMed} system, require significant effort on the part of the searcher, and inexperienced searchers do not use these systems as effectively as experienced users. Improved literature search engines can save researchers time and effort by making it easier to locate the most important and relevant {literature.Results:} We have created and optimized a new, hybrid search system for Medline that takes natural text as input and then delivers results with high precision and recall. The combination of a fast, low-sensitivity weighted keyword-based first pass algorithm to cast a wide net to gather an initial set of literature, followed by a unique sentence-alignment based similarity algorithm to rank order those results was developed that is sensitive, fast and easy to use. Several text similarity search algorithms, both standard and novel, were implemented and tested in order to determine which obtained the best results in information retrieval {exercises.Availability:} Literature searching algorithms are implemented in a system called {eTBLAST}, freely accessible over the web at http://invention.swmed.edu. A variety of other derivative systems and visualization tools provides the user with an enhanced experience and additional {capabilities.Contact:Harold.Garner@UTSouthwestern.edu}},
